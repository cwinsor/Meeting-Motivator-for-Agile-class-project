# Meeting-Motivator-for-Agile-class-project
Meeting Motivator for Agile is an Android application to get control of the start time of your Agile Scrum.
The problem is - people start showing up late, then others start to 'game' the system by expecting a late start and showing up late themselves.  Also - the Scrum Master doesn't know if that last person or two is on their way (seconds away) or hopelessly stuck in a traffic jam.

To get control of the meeting start time - the application uses GPS on attendees android phone to identify location, and use Google Maps to predict arrival times.

The project was developed for the "Mobile and Ubiquitous" course at WPI.
