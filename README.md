# Meeting-Motivator-for-Agile-class-project
Meeting Motivator for Agile is an Android application to get control of the start time of your Agile Scrum.
The problem is people start showing up late and then others start to 'game' the system by expecting a late start and showing up late themselves.  And the Scrum Master doesn't know if they should start the meeting - is that last person or two just seconds away from arriving or hopelessly stuck in traffic.  The application uses GPS on attendees Android phone to identify location and uses Google Maps to predict arrival times.  Reminders with behavior-specific 'nag' level were planned. The project was developed for the "Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing" course at WPI.
